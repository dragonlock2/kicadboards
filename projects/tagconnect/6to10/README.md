# 6to10

This board documents the standardized pinout for the programming header of all boards moving forward, named "standard". The previous SWD/UART header pinout will be called "legacy". Pinouts standardized in industry are called "normal".

Specifically, this board converts the 10pin standard programmer header to the 6pin standard target pinout.
