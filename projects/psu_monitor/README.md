# psu_monitor

Adding current and voltage monitoring to a salvaged PSU along with a GUI and software controlled high side switches. I didn't realize shorting the 5V rail on the PSU causes a spike on release, killing all of my chips. I have since bought a bench PSU, so this project is on indefinite hold.
