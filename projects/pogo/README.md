# pogo

Designed April 2020

A bunch of boards to test out making Tag-Connect cables at home.

- pogo/ is the very first attempt at making a cable
- pogo_6breakout/ is a breakout for the 6 pin version, with holes instead of pads for some reason
- pogo_6pin/ is the successful 6 pin version
- pogo_breakout/ is a breakout for the 10 pin version
- pogo_test_f103/ is a fun test board for the 10 pin version. The crystal driver on my STLINK-V2 broke but I was able to desolder the chip and get USB working with the internal oscillator :P
- pogo_v2/ is the successful 10 pin version
