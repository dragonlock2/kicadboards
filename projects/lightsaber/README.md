# lightsaber v5

The 5th iteration of my lightsaber project. I finally understand how it all works.

- **blade** - attaches to an LED strip
- **socket** - solder pogo pins to connect to the blade
- **board** - low cost ATtiny1616-based board to implement basic lightsaber functionality

## Revisions
