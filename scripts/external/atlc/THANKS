****HELP from testers****
I'm always willing to know of systems on which atlc either passes or fails 
its tests. This is particularly so of the uncommon platforms, operating
systems or versions of Linux. I hope I have not forgotten anyone
in the list below. If so let me know and I'll add you to the list. 

David Anderson GM4JJJ for testing. 
Steve Thompson G8GSQ for testing and finding a real bug affecting Suse. 
Bdale Garbee for finding a bug in the way hardware information was displayed.
Mark testing on his AMD Barton 2800+. 
Ron Patterson for also finding a bug about hardware information.
Paul for testing on 'relic' and 'speedy'
Theo v. Werkhoven for testing on Linux
Bob Cole for testing on his UnixWare system.
Tom Cage K5GI for testing on a number of platforms. 
Daniel Schafer for testing on Gentoo Linux. 
Oddbjorn Hansen for testing on Suse Linux 
Tavis Ormandy for testing on Gentoo Linux for Alpha. 

And last, but my no means least, to those dedicated people at 
http://www.cray-cyber.org/general/start.php
for providing access to a Cray supercomputer for testing on that. 
I never thought I'd be able to test atlc on a Cray.
