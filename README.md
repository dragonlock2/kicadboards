# kicadboards

Hello there! This is the place for all of the little boards that I work on that don't really fit anywhere else. It's also to help open source designs others can reference and I can provide links to.

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/dragonlock2/kicadboards.git
```

Schematic PDFs are automatically generated and deployed at [matthewtran.dev/kicadboards](https://matthewtran.dev/kicadboards).
