# micro_peripherals

Designed December 2021

I like to add a 10pin 1.27mm header to my microcontroller boards that breaks out SPI, I2C, CAN, and/or UART in a standardized pinout. This board adds a SPI device (ATtiny10 programmed in assembly), I2C EEPROM, and CAN transceiver (which also acts as a UART loopback) for validation.
